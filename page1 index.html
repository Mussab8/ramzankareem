<p>Ramadan is a sacred month observed by millions of Muslims around the world, marking a time of fasting, prayer, self-reflection, and devotion. It is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar and is believed to be the month in which the Quran was first revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). During this month, Muslims fast from dawn until sunset, refraining from food, drink, and other physical needs as a way of purifying the soul, practicing self-discipline, and strengthening their connection with Allah. The pre-dawn meal, known as Suhoor, and the evening meal, Iftar, hold deep cultural and spiritual significance, often bringing families and communities together. Beyond abstaining from food, Ramadan is also a time for increased acts of worship, such as reading the Quran, performing extra prayers like Taraweeh, and giving to those in need through charity and Zakat. The month teaches patience, gratitude, and empathy, reminding believers of the struggles of the less fortunate and encouraging kindness and generosity. As the month progresses, Muslims seek spiritual growth and forgiveness, making special prayers during the last ten nights, especially on Laylat al-Qadr, the Night of Decree, which is considered the holiest night of the year. Ramadan culminates in the joyous celebration of Eid al-Fitr, a festival of gratitude, feasting, and togetherness, where families and friends gather to share meals, exchange gifts, and extend warm wishes. More than just a religious obligation, Ramadan serves as a period of renewal, strengthening faith, and reinforcing values of compassion, unity, and self-improvement.</p>
